A game inspired by freecodecamps but with my own twist! This is Dragon Repeller from freecodecamp but with my twist. Im learning js and 
decided while watching their tutorial instead of following line for line I am going to try to build the game with just the starter code that they gave to see what i can come up with, and this is it. 
(currently a work in progress)
