A game inspired by freecodecamps but with my own twist!

A game inspired by freecodecamps but with my own twist! This is Dragon Repeller from freecodecamp but with my twist. Im learning js and 
decided while watching their tutorial instead of following line for line I am going to try to build the game with just the starter code that they gave to see what i can come up with, and this is it. 
(currently a work in progress)
Instruction (if it wasnt already clear)
1. navigate using buttons.
2. your not allowed to use shop and fight at the same time for obvious reasons
3. buy gear to fight mobs and level up your hp and gear to fight stronger monsters!
