A game inspired by freecodecamps but with my own twist! I'm learning JS and decided while watching their tutorial instead of following line for line I am going to try to build the game with just the starter code that they gave to see what I can come up with, and this is it. 

It is currently a work in progress.

Instructions:

1. Navigate using buttons.
2. You're not allowed to use shop and fight at the same time for obvious reasons.
3. Buy gear to fight mobs and level up your hp and gear to fight stronger monsters!
